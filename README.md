# Deep-L-Layer-Neural-Network-From-Scratch
A python package that implements a deep L‑layer neural network from scratch using NumPy, with configurable architectures and support for ReLU, tanh, and sigmoid activations. It also provides a complete training pipeline—feed‑forward, loss computation, back‑propagation, parameter updates—and seamless model persistence via save/load methods.
